A similar approach is already used in numerous standards, such as OpenPGP user notation.\r\n```\r\n[provider FQDN]._validation.[hostmaster FQDN]\r\n```\r\nThis eliminates a wide swath of issues: the format, meaning, applicability, and scope of the TXT record can be left to the discretion of the provider, and additional namespaces can be specified trivially.\r\n\r\nThis structure lends itself naturally to the proposed DNAME record mentioned in #26: a hostmaster wishing to redirect certain validation records could place a DNAME anywhere in that sequence, even scoping it by provider.",

Even within Apple, there are entirely distinct things that the validation may be meant for, and an attacker might be able to exploit the collision. Unless you want to make a registry for labels like `apple-challenge`, tying it to a domain controlled by the provider seems the best approach.\r\n\r\n> I am curious though as to why `example-merchant-identifier` label is needed in your example.\r\n\r\nThis is for the same reason: it narrows what the validation applies to. In that example, the domain is validating that it is connected to a specific merchant in the specific context of Apple Pay.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn the not-implausible scenario of requiring revalidation on a regular basis (like with ACME), the domain holder would likely wish to automate the process using RFC 2136 (DDNS). When granting access to the zone, making the scope this narrow alleviates the risk of compromise considerably, as the credentials used to update the record cannot be exploited to accomplish something else (such as connecting the domain to an attacker's merchant ID).\r\n\r\nWith ACME's `dns-01` challenge, you can accomplish something similar using CAA record tags like `accounturi`.",

Keybase offers a similar system, and Mastodon [already](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification) allows you to validate control of a webpage using HTML, so this is not implausible.\r\n\r\nAny domain can be a Mastodon server, and a user's handle is not necessarily scoped to that server either. For instance, a user `@delegated@example.com` might want their account with `mastodon.example` to prove control of `example.net`. Something like `mastodon-challenge` wouldn't make sense, as other forks of Mastodon may use a different format and there may be multiple servers running the same fork. The distinguishing factor must be the domain of the provider. There may be many accounts trying to establish control as well: each employee of a startup might want to prove their personal account is connected to the company website, for example. To avoid an abundance of TXT records in one DNS request (especially since this would be perpetual), the handle should be part of the label as well.\r\n\r\n```dns\r\ndelegated._example.com._user.mastodon.example._validation.example.net.

For example:\r\n_provider-token.example.com. IN TXT \"type=activation\\_only expiry=2023-10-12 token=TOKENDATA\"\r\nIf a provider requires the continued precense of the TXT record as proof that the domain owner is still authorizing the service, this should also be clear from the TXT record RDATA. For example:\r\n_provider-service.example.com. IN TXT \"type=continued_service expiry=never token=TOKENDATA\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn discussion with Shumon, I'd deleted this text in https://github.com/ietf-wg-dnsop/draft-ietf-dnsop-domain-verification-techniques/pull/29; the rationale IIRC was that we weren't being clear enough: if the intention is to have the records be parsed automatically and acted upon, we need to prescribe the terms \"activation_only/continued_service\". This was the replacement text: \"Providers MUST provide clear instructions on when a verifying record can be removed. The user SHOULD de-provision the resource record(s) provisioned for a DNS-based domain verification challenge once the challenge is complete.\" \r\n\r\n@paulwouters pointed out that it would be extremely useful to have an expiry timestamp for management purposes, and possibly also encode the domain revalidation information somehow into the RDATA. \r\n\r\nWhat should we do?",

This is an important topic to cover in considerably more detail, however.  In particular, some systems want to validate an apex domain while others want to validate each particular hostname.  It is critical that validation record and its contents are unambiguous as to which of these is the case.\r\n\r\nAs an example, ACME has separate mechanisms for wildcard certs (eg, \"*.example.com\") vs individual names (eg, \"bar.example.com\").\r\nThis is likely to apply across the board to these systems: sometimes they want to validate usage for a domain and sometimes for just specific names. \r\n\r\nFor the individual hostname case, it is important to clarify that the challenge should be \"_foo-challenge.bar.example.com\". \r\n\r\nFor the whole domain case this could be  \"_foo-wildcard-challenge.example.com\"  or have an attribute in the TXT token (eg, wildcard=true).    ACME (rfc8555 section-8.4) doesn't seem to have this differentiation, which seems unfortunate, unless I'm misreading.\r\nI'd think that it should be unambiguous to domain admins whether a challenge is for just the \"example.com\" name, for \"*.example.com\", or for \"example.com, *.example.com, *.*.example,com, etc\". \r\n\r\nWhat it means to validate a hostname or a domain or a wildcard set of hostnames may vary widely per application, and we may want to talk more about the security considerations here.\r\n\r\nAmbiguities about whether a given verification token grants powers over a specific hostname or an entire domain also introduce security challenges that we may wish to talk about in Security Considerations.  DNS domain administrators need to be able to understand the consequences of adding in particular challenge entries into their domain, especially in cases like a multi-tenant Enterprise environment.\r\n \r\n2) Public suffixes\r\n\r\nWe may wish to encourage (or require) validating against Public Suffix lists (eg, https://publicsuffix.org/), in the absence of a more general DBOUND solution.  At a minimum we should discuss this in security considerations.\r\n\r\nOne Security Consideration is that services operating a public suffix should take extreme care about when they allow underscore labels to be created within a shared domain.  As an example, if a service provider allows \"_foo-challenge.publicsuffix.example\" to be registered as a domain (for a DNS registrar) or to be created as a CNAME or TXT record (eg, for a dynamic DNS provider or cloud provider) then this might grant unintended powers over all of \"publicsuffix.example\".\r\n\r\nWe may also want to (encourage? require?) confirming that a user isn't trying to place a validation token on a public suffix.  ACME has this as a \"CA Policy Consideration\" (Section 10.5 of rfc8555).  There are some legitimate use-cases here, but caution (and perhaps extra validation?) is needed.\r\n\r\n(For the Appendix, another example would be the PSL itself.  Per https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki/Guidelines\r\nIt uses \"_psl.alphaexample.com TXT https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/100\" for validation.)\r\n\r\n3) SaaS/Paas/intermediary provider cases (eg, CDNs)\r\n\r\nA common use-case is for delegation of control over to an intermediate.  For example, indicating that a SaaS provider or CDN may manage certificates for \"foo.example.com\".  One way to handle this is to have CNAME the challenge to that intermediary and then the intermediary returns the TXT record.  For example, you might have:\r\n\r\n_acme-challenge.foo.example.com. IN CNAME ${TOKENA}.intermediate-provider.example.\r\n${TOKENA}.intermediate-provider.example.  IN TXT  ${TOKENB}\r\n\r\nThis allows .intermediate-provider.example to keep updating TOKENB\r\nfor each renewal.  (It's not reasonable for the intermediate provider to tell their customer\r\nto go back and require updating _acme-challenge.foo.example.com every three months.)\r\n\r\nThis is often going to be done alongside delegating the hostname\r\nto the intermediate provider.  For example, there will likely also be a CNAME of:\r\n\r\n   foo.example.com. IN CNAME foo-example-com.cdn.example.\r\n\r\nThe separate CNAMEs (ie, these being distinct labels) are important because\r\nthe certificate and validation needs to happen before actually moving the hostname over.\r\n\r\nThis is a case where the CNAME for \"_acme-challenge.foo.example.com\" generally needs to be persistent\r\nfor frequent/periodic renewals.\r\n\r\nOf critical importance is that TOKENA is also secure and has enough entropy\r\nand is tied to the particular customer account that provisioned foo.example.com.\r\n\r\nIn the draft we probably want to talk about this as cases where there is a CNAME to the TXT record,\r\nand that the target of the CNAME needs to itself always have a token with adequate cryptographic entropy.\r\n\r\nWe might mention in A.1.4 on Time-bound checking that cert renewals are a case where\r\npersistence is required, at least of a CNAME to a provider who may be managing the renewals.\r\n\r\n3a) Leveraging ACME challenges for other purposes\r\n\r\nA related question worth considering:  when is it acceptable to leverage ACME challenge for other purposes?  For example, if moving a domain onto a CDN that is going to get a certificate for the domain prior to the migration but which also wants to validate that it is authorized for the domain to be transferred to it, when can the ACME challenge also be leveraged for both purposes?\r\nI'm not sure we need to go into this, but perhaps it should be discussed.\r\n\r\n4) Multi-provider / multi-CDN setups\r\n\r\nA related and messier corner-case are multi-provider / multi-CDN setups.\r\nFor example, \"foo.example.com\" may CNAME to one of three different CDNs.\r\nEach one of these needs to be able to manage a certificate and renew it every three months.\r\nThis likely applies to some of these other cases as well.  I don't have good answers --- ACME doesn't\r\nhandle this terribly well today --- but it is worth some thought as to how to handle.\r\n\r\n5) Token format / construction\r\n\r\nIt seems like the actual token contents should have more flexibility.\r\nI don't think we want a \"MUST\" on that particular construct.  It may be worth\r\na MUST that there is at least 128 bits of secure entropy, and that the token is\r\neither base64 or hex encoded.  But there may be a need to use other\r\nconstructs in the future (eg, not SHA256).   Giving the current example\r\nas a MAY seems reasonable. \r\n\r\nThere may be reasons for other constructs that embed state within the token.\r\nFor example:  \"HMAC-SHA256(private_key, label+account+domain)\" may be appropriate in some cases,\r\nalthough has enough security considerations that I'm not sure we want to include that.\r\n\r\n6) Binding tokens to requests\r\n\r\nWe should have a note on the critical importance of binding the token to the requesting account and to the requested name.\r\nAt a minimum this should be in Security Considerations, but it may also wish to be normative.\r\nUsage here typically follows a flow of:\r\n  a) user/account requests a token for a given $name from a service provider\r\n  b) user/account has their DNS admin put their token in for _challenge.$name\r\n  c) service validates that _challenge.$name has $token and then grants access to the user/account\r\n\r\nThere are chains of custody here and linkages that need to happen, and are exploitable if they break down.\r\nFor example, if steps (a) and (c) aren't explicitly linked then a different user on a different account\r\ncould potentially jump in at step c and grab access.  There may be other corner cases here,\r\nand it may be worth some more detailed formal analysis to be able to express what properties are critical\r\nfor safety.\r\n\r\nThere may be a related Security Consideration that I'm not sure how to handle where a MitM style attack could jump in before step (a).  For example, if the user is phished into talking to a different service provider than they thought they were talking to.  (I'm not sure this needs to be discussed, but is a risk.)\r\n\r\n7) TTL recommendations\r\n\r\nWe should provide some TTL recommendations for the TXT record, and perhaps also provide\r\na warning on long SOA (negative caching) TTLs.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a case where we'd want to recommend using short TTLs on the TXT record\r\nto allow recovering from misconfigurations.  These shouldn't be polled frequently so cachability\r\nis unlikely to be an issue, but if there's a typo and the TTL is long then there may not be a way\r\nto recover since the validator may have the bad entry cached for the TTL.\r\n\r\nA long SOA TTL (ie, negative caching TTL) could also cause issues.\r\nOnce the service provider issues the challenge the validator may start polling for its presence.\r\nThe first attempts are likely to get an NXDOMAIN, and if the NXDOMAIN is cached too long\r\nthis could cause user confusion and/or delay the validation.\r\n(I'm not sure it's reasonable to suggest that validators bound the maximum NXDOMAIN caching time?)\r\n\r\n8) Policy constraints as a variant\r\n\r\nWithin ACME, challenge tokens exist as only one part of the validation process.\r\nThey act as an explicit \"allow this particular name to be issued this particular cert based on a CSR\".\r\nThere is also another safeguard, however, which is the CAA record.  That acts as a policy-based constraint.\r\n\r\nAs we are generalizing the challenges, it may be worth considering generalizing the policy-based constraints.\r\nFor example, in an enterprise environment \"example.com\" may wish to limit the use of _foo-challenge\r\nunder their domain so that bar.quux.example.com can't put in \"_foo-challenge.bar.quux.example.com\".\r\n(More concretely, example.com may wish to limit the CDNs and/or SaaS providers that can be used\r\nwithin their domain.)\r\n\r\nThis is almost certainly substantial scope creep for this draft, but without it domain admins\r\nmay be unable to apply policies or manage the sort of risks managed with CAA records.\r\n\r\nThis might be as simple as allowing the definition of _foo-constraint.example.com as a TXT record,\r\nwith whoever defines _foo-challenge also defining the format of _foo-constraint.\r\nAs part of validating _foo-challenge.bar.quux.example.com, validators should look for\r\n_foo-constraint.example.com and _foo-constraint.quux.example.com and _foo-constraint.bar.quux.example.com\r\nand implementing their constraints when present.\r\n\r\n9) Registry of labels?\r\n\r\nI hate to ask it, but is there a need for a registry of _foo-challenge labels?\r\nIt seems like there could be potential security and operational risks\r\nof multiple entities starting to use \"_foo-challenge\" for unrelated purposes.\r\n\r\n10) Security review\r\n\r\nGiven that domain verification is often used as part of security systems,\r\nit seems like it would be worth getting some additional security review,\r\nsuch as bringing this to SAAG?\r\n\r\nThanks again for working on this much needed draft!",

      "body": "(from Erik)\r\n\r\nAPEX domains, and hostnames vs domains\r\n\r\nYou define APEX but don't then reference this.  This is an important topic to cover in considerably more detail, however.  In particular, some systems want to validate an apex domain while others want to validate each particular hostname.  It is critical that validation record and its contents are unambiguous as to which of these is the case.\r\n\r\nAs an example, ACME has separate mechanisms for wildcard certs (eg, \"*.example.com\") vs individual names (eg, \"bar.example.com\").\r\nThis is likely to apply across the board to these systems: sometimes they want to validate usage for a domain and sometimes for just specific names. \r\n\r\nFor the individual hostname case, it is important to clarify that the challenge should be \"_foo-challenge.bar.example.com\". \r\n\r\nFor the whole domain case this could be  \"_foo-wildcard-challenge.example.com\"  or have an attribute in the TXT token (eg, wildcard=true).    ACME (rfc8555 section-8.4) doesn't seem to have this differentiation, which seems unfortunate, unless I'm misreading.\r\nI'd think that it should be unambiguous to domain admins whether a challenge is for just the \"example.com\" name, for \"*.example.com\", or for \"example.com, *.example.com, *.*.example,com, etc\". \r\n\r\nWhat it means to validate a hostname or a domain or a wildcard set of hostnames may vary widely per application, and we may want to talk more about the security considerations here.\r\n\r\nAmbiguities about whether a given verification token grants powers over a specific hostname or an entire domain also introduce security challenges that we may wish to talk about in Security Considerations.  DNS domain administrators need to be able to understand the consequences of adding in particular challenge entries into their domain, especially in cases like a multi-tenant Enterprise environment.\r\n\r\n",

Metadata in the record is mainly for the domain owner's bookkeeping. As long as the Service Provider knows what the scope is of the verifying record, why does it have to be in the DNS record itself? It doesn't affect how a Service Provider queries for the record, and it doesn't affect the size of the DNS response. What is the practical use? I suspect this is why ACME doesn't include it either.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is worth discussing in some detail in Security Considerations, but not prescribe record metadata for. Thoughts?",

At a minimum we should discuss this in security considerations.\r\n\r\nOne Security Consideration is that services operating a public suffix should take extreme care about when they allow underscore labels to be created within a shared domain.  As an example, if a service provider allows \"_foo-challenge.publicsuffix.example\" to be registered as a domain (for a DNS registrar) or to be created as a CNAME or TXT record (eg, for a dynamic DNS provider or cloud provider) then this might grant unintended powers over all of \"publicsuffix.example\".\r\n\r\nWe may also want to (encourage? require?) confirming that a user isn't trying to place a validation token on a public suffix.  ACME has this as a \"CA Policy Consideration\" (Section 10.5 of rfc8555).  There are some legitimate use-cases here, but caution (and perhaps extra validation?) is needed.\r\n\r\n(For the Appendix, another example would be the PSL itself.

For example, indicating that a SaaS provider or CDN may manage certificates for \"foo.example.com\".  One way to handle this is to have CNAME the challenge to that intermediary and then the intermediary returns the TXT record.  For example, you might have:\r\n\r\n_acme-challenge.foo.example.com. IN CNAME ${TOKENA}.intermediate-provider.example.\r\n${TOKENA}.intermediate-provider.example.  IN TXT  ${TOKENB}\r\n\r\nThis allows .intermediate-provider.example to keep updating TOKENB\r\nfor each renewal.  (It's not reasonable for the intermediate provider to tell their customer\r\nto go back and require updating _acme-challenge.foo.example.com every three months.)\r\n\r\nThis is often going to be done alongside delegating the hostname\r\nto the intermediate provider.  For example, there will likely also be a CNAME of:\r\n\r\n   foo.example.com. IN CNAME foo-example-com.cdn.example.\r\n\r\nThe separate CNAMEs (ie, these being distinct labels) are important because\r\nthe certificate and validation needs to happen before actually moving the hostname over.\r\n\r\nThis is a case where the CNAME for \"_acme-challenge.foo.example.com\" generally needs to be persistent\r\nfor frequent/periodic renewals.\r\n\r\nOf critical importance is that TOKENA is also secure and has enough entropy\r\nand is tied to the particular customer account that provisioned foo.example.com.\r\n\r\nIn the draft we probably want to talk about this as cases where there is a CNAME to the TXT record,\r\nand that the target of the CNAME needs to itself always have a token with adequate cryptographic entropy.\r\n\r\nWe might mention in A.1.4 on Time-bound checking that cert renewals are a case where\r\npersistence is required, at least of a CNAME to a provider who may be managing the renewals.",

Also in large organizations there may be many different parts that be licensing a software requiring its own domain verification record. It has been observed that some well known domains had so many services, as well as different versions of the same service, deployed hat their DNS TXT answer did not fit in a single UDP DNS packet.\r\n\r\nThis results in fragmentation which is known to be vulnerable to various attacks ({{!AVOID-FRAGMENTATION=I-D.ietf-dnsop-avoid-fragmentation}}). It can also lead to UDP packet truncation, causing a retry over TCP. Not all networks properly transport DNS over TCP and some DNS software mistakenly believe TCP support is optional ({{RFC9210}}).\r\n",

So I have some experience with its entries.\r\n\r\nThere is a use case for people registering names in that registry to avoid clashing. Eg if Company X would have something database like at _db.example.com it would be good not to conflict with Company Y that uses the same record for another type of database service on the same prefix. If both do some service discovery via dns they might make the wrong assumption about the service they are connecting too (eg wrong vendor / product protocol).\r\n\r\nBut in our use case, there is no real conflict. We are not running a service on these dns names. It\u2019s just the dns lookup itself that has the data.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, we encourage using known vendor name and service name so that in itself avoids conflicts. Registering these names is extra effort for companies that have no IANA relationship and it will also just pollute the underscore registry with a lot of vendor names. It might cause people to need to talk to lawyers about trademarks.\r\n\r\nIt might be good to advise the readers to check the underscore registry to avoid collisions, eg for a company that happens to be called dmarc so they can use \u201c_dmarc-llc\u201d or something. But I see no reason to register new entries. Eg what is the value for Aiven to add _aiven there ? The chance of another company called Aiven that also is in tech that also has services they want to validate via an _aiven prefix is about zero. And if it happens, it doesn\u2019t actually matter if there would be two _aiven records at the customer where each one verifies one vendor/service.\r\n\r\nPaul",

So, let's use a specific example. \r\n\r\nThe application provider \"foobar\" wants the user of the \"example.com\" domain, and one of their accounts \"xjbhkrt\" on the foobar service to deploy a challenge record in their DNS with the challenge token \"ORUGKIDROVUWG2ZAMJZG653OEBTG66AK\". \r\n\r\nSo the application provider has provided all 3 variables here, account label, application label, and token data:\r\n\r\nxjbhkrt._foobar-challenge.example.com. IN TXT \"ORUGKIDROVUWG2ZAMJZG653OEBTG66AK\"\r\n\r\nThe application label is closest to the root, and presumably a recognizable string that the user can visually associate with the application provider. The account label and challenge token are more random looking strings. There are no variable prefix & suffixes within the same label.\r\n\r\nCan you elaborate on the threat here?\r\n",

For example, it would apply to \"foo.example.com\"\r\n      but not \"example.com\" nor \"quux.bar.example.com\"\r\n\r\n   *  \"_<PROVIDER_RELEVANT_NAME>-domain-challenge.example.com\" applies\r\n      to the entire domain \"example.com\" as well as its subdomains.

      "body": "(This may want to be its own separate draft?)\r\n\r\nOne challenge not covered in the current draft is how authoritative DNS server operators can validate new domains that have been recently registered.  In the case where a domain has been created in a registrar and delegated to a DNS server operator, there's a window where the delegation is \"lame\" and not yet configured on the DNS server operator.  In this window, an attacker could register this domain on the DNS server operator.  This is more common in the case where a domain is registered and delegated but not provisioned (or provisioned and later deleted), allowing attackers to register the domain on the DNS server operator.  \r\n\r\nAs called out in this article by Brian Krebs, this is being actively exploited:  https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/dont-let-your-domain-name-become-a-sitting-duck/  There are even teams of security researchers that look for domains that have been in this state for awhile and register them at various DNS server operators (eg, http://domainoverwatch.com/).\r\n\r\nWhile TXT record validation works for existing zones that are on another operator already and want to be transferred or added, this doesn't work for new domains.  (Requiring new domains be registered through DNS operators is another option, but not necessarily desirable.)\r\n\r\nOne option we might specify would be to encode this in an an additional delegation record on a specific name at the registrar.  For example, customers of the DNS operator might normally delegate to authorities ns1.example.com through ns4.example.com.  For the validation case, there would be an additional authority that is out-of-bailiwick in which we\u2019d encode the token.  For example, registrants would be requested to add NS records in the registrar for:\r\n\r\n\t$domain\tIN NS\tns1.example.com.\r\n\t\u2026\r\n\t$domain\tIN NS\tns2.example.com.\r\n\t$domain\tIN NS\tns-<base32token>.authdnsdv.example.net.\r\n\r\nThis would allow validation of the domain.\r\nFor .net domains an operator might instead use ns-<base32token>.authdnsdv.example.com.\r\n\r\nThe DNS operator would need entries for the A and AAAA records for *.authdnsdv.example.{com,net} of the DNS authorities.  Given the out-of-bailiwick nature this would be less likely to be used.  Registrants could remove this if they want once the domain is created.\r\n\r\nPart of the need for out-of-bailiwick would be to make sure no glue was present or needed in the parent zone.  The child zone would not have/need this authority record.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "# SecDir review of draft-ietf-dnsop-domain-verification-techniques-05\r\nCC @kaduk\r\n\r\nSince the changes from the -01 that I previously reviewed are so substantial,\r\nthis is mostly a de novo review.  The main comment on the diff is on the\r\nweakening of the guidance to enable DNSSEC validation from MUST to SHOULD,\r\nwhich I assume had ample WG discussion.  Perhaps the identified exception\r\ncases that keep it from being a MUST could be mentioned in the draft, though?\r\n\r\nOn the whole, though, this is good stuff, and I'll be happy to see it\r\npublished.  The one \"discuss\" point is mostly about being clear about what the\r\nactual requirements are for domain control validation and what we believe\r\nwe're getting from the random token -- while I believe that our recommendation\r\nis secure and the right general recommendation, the PSL example seems to be a\r\ncase that does securely perform the validation, but without a random token,\r\nwhich is a good opportunity for us to think about the underlying requirements.\r\n\r\n## Discuss\r\n\r\n### Recommendation for random token\r\n\r\nIn toplevel \u00a75 we say that \"an issued random token then needs to exist in at\r\nleast one of these to demonstrate the User has control over the domain name\r\nin-question\", but this could stand to be more precise.  While I agree that the\r\nrandom token is needed in general, we should be talking about which of\r\nunguessable, probabilistically collision-free, unique, bound to a given\r\nissuance event, etc. are needed.  (We say just (\u00a75.1) \"128 bits of entropy\",\r\nwhich is plenty to give the first three properties but needs a bit of help\r\n(underscore prefix) to get the last, and doesn't say which properties we're\r\nrelying on that entropy for.)  In particular the scheme used by the PSL\r\n(\u00a7A.1.1.5) does not use a random token but as far as I can tell it is fit for\r\npurpose, so I would say that the core underlying requirement is not just\r\n\"random\".  I'll include some notes from my analysis below, with suggestion\r\nthat we both clarify the specifics of the requirement (and why that translates\r\nto needing to be random in the general case) and include in \u00a7A.1.1.5 some\r\ndiscussion of why this the PSL flow is a secure flow.\r\n\r\nThe PSL's verification scheme (\u00a7A.1.1.5) uses a github pull request URL rather\r\nthan a random token.  It seems like this is actually a secure flow, since it\r\ndoes provide a clear binding to intent to perform the requested operation\r\nand is collision-free (by use of a central authority).  But to assess that, we\r\nreally need to enumerage the risks that a DCV scheme needs to protect against.\r\nThis list is going to include at least:\r\n- collisions, where an authorizing DNS record intended to authorize use at one\r\n  service provider also authorizes use at another (this is most prominent when\r\n  using a TXT record at the name being verified itself but may show up\r\n  elsewhere))\r\n- forwarding of challenge values from one service provider to another (so\r\n  that a user authorizes an application other than the one they intend to)\r\n- more generally, confusion between the application and user about the scope\r\n  of what is being authorized (e.g., single domain vs wildcard, among others)\r\n- an attacker guessing what the verification token will be and causing the\r\n  corresponding DNS record to exist through means other than the authorization\r\n  flow\r\n\r\nBy having github generate the token (a URL) in a way that guarantees\r\nuniqueness, we prevent collisions, and the PR content covers what the intended\r\naction being confirmed is.  It is pretty possible to guess what an upcoming\r\nverification token would be, but it seems pretty challenging to get someone to\r\ncreate a DNS record pointing to a URL that talks about something totally\r\ndifferent.  So while prediction/collision is possible, it seems pretty easy to\r\ndetect as malicious and avoid using the collided URL.\r\n\r\nThe PR also gets a nice binding of intent, since the literal operation being\r\nauthorized is right there in the page referenced by the URL; for the scheme we\r\nrecommend we need to combine both the underscore prefix and the random token\r\nto get an indication of intent (as provider plus unique token for specific\r\nauthorization event), and even then rely on the provider's docs/UI to be clear\r\nabout what they're doing on their end.\r\n\r\nBut for all I'm lauding the PSL method, it's not suitable for general use\r\nsince there's not a central authority to assign numbers/URLs, nor is there a\r\ngeneric way to have the token/URL clearly refer to the operation being\r\nauthorized.  And in many cases the parties involved don't want the operation\r\nbeing authorized to be particularly public -- the PSL is a rare case in that\r\nthe whole point of it is to be public!\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n\r\nI remain a little nervous about allocating a new BCP number for a topic of\r\nfairly narrow scope such as this, but the guidance is good and worth\r\npublishing, and I have not better alternative to offer, so I will continue to\r\nstifle any objection I might have raised.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the content is reasonable, but read on for some suggestions on\r\nhow to tighten things up and some questions about why all the pieces are\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nI also created a pull request with some editorial suggestions, at\r\nhttps://github.com/ietf-wg-dnsop/draft-ietf-dnsop-domain-verification-techniques/pull/149\r\n\r\n### Use of \"foo\" as example content\r\n\r\nA bunch of examples use challenge names like _[foo-challenge.example.com](http://foo-challenge.example.com/), but\r\nof course neither _foo nore _foo-challenge is present in the Underscored and\r\nGlobally Scoped DNS Node Names registry.  There is an entry for _example, but\r\neven an _[example-challenge.example.com](http://example-challenge.example.com/) entry would probably be confusing since\r\nthe two \"example\"s serve different purposes.  Do we want to register something\r\nless \"foo\"-like and use it for documentation purposes?\r\n\r\n### Registry for validation record RDATA metadata\r\n\r\nIt looks like we specify the \"token\" and \"expiry\" metadata keys for the RDATA\r\nformat.  Do we want a registry or some other guidance to application service\r\nproviders about avoiding conflicts within their own usage and with any future\r\nevolution of this BCP that adds more metadata keys?\r\n\r\n### Proposal or Actual guidance\r\n\r\nThe abstract says that this document \"proposes\" some best practices, but it\r\nseems to me that with this level of review we can safely say that it\r\n\"provides\" some best practices.  (There is one other instance of the word\r\n\"proposes\" in the body of the document but it does not seem to have as broad\r\nof a scope as this one in the abstract.\r\n\r\n### fragmentation often does not work\r\n\r\nIn \u00a73 we write:\r\n\r\n> this may result in IP fragmentation, which often does not work reliably on\r\n> the Internet today due to firewalls and middleboxes, and also is vulnerable\r\n> to various attacks ([AVOID-FRAGMENTATION])\r\n\r\nBut [AVOID-FRAGMENTATION] seems to mostly be a reference for the attacks\r\npossible, and I don't see much in there to support the \"often does not work\r\nreliably\" part.  That, in turn, is a statement that probably does merit a\r\nreference, so hopefully we have a decent one handy.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent \"Not all networks properly transmit DNS over TCP\" might benefit\r\nfrom a reference to supplement RFC 9210 as well, but RFC 9210 does have at\r\nleast some coverage of the topic.\r\n\r\n### Direction of authority flow\r\n\r\nIn \u00a73 we say:\r\n\r\n> In the more general case of an Internet application service granting\r\n> authority to a domain owner, again no existing DNS challenge scheme makes\r\n> this distinction today.\r\n\r\nBut I am not sure I understand why the statement is written such that\r\nauthority is flowing from the application service to the domain owner; I would\r\nhave expected the authority to flow the other direction.\r\n\r\n### Hiding provider use\r\n\r\nIn \u00a75.2 we say:\r\n\r\n> An Application Service Provider may also specify prepending a random token to\r\nthe name, such as \"<RANDOM_TOKEN>._<PROVIDER_RELEVANT_NAME>-challenge\". This\r\ncan be done either as part of the challenge itself (Section 5.9, to support\r\nmultiple Intermediaries (Section 5.5), or to make it harder for a third party\r\nto scan what Application Service Providers are being used by a given domain\r\nname.\r\n\r\nbut I am not sure how difficult this actually makes the scanning process.\r\nPer RFC 8020 shouldn't a query for _<PROVIDER_RELEVANT_NAME>-[challenge.name](http://challenge.name/)\r\ngive NODATA if there is a record for a child name with a random token, which\r\nwould be distinguishable from the NXDOMAIN that is expected if the provider is\r\nnot being used?  (Similarly for the last paragraph of \u00a75.5.)\r\n\r\n### Challenge scoping status\r\n\r\nIn \u00a75.2.1 we note that [ACME-SCOPED-CHALLENGE] has incorporated the scope\r\nindication format proposed here, but up in \u00a74 we say that \"no existing DNS\r\nchallenge scheme makes this distinction today\".  Since the ACME work is just\r\nan I-D and thus work in progress, these two statements may not be technically\r\nin conflict, but we might want to wordsmith slightly to clarify how they are\r\naligned with each other.\r\n\r\n### Equivalent forms of specifying RDATA\r\n\r\nIn \u00a75.3.2 we note that RDATA of \"token=3419...3d206c4\" is semantically\r\nequivalent to that of just \"3419...3d206c4\".  This raises two questions: (1)\r\ndo we actually want to recommend two equivalent options for doing something vs\r\njust always having a single right way to do things?  (2) If the answer to (1)\r\nis 'yes', shouldn't we say that the application service provider needs to\r\nspecify which format expects (or require them to accept either form)?\r\n\r\n### Additional safety checks\r\n\r\nThe closing note of the security considerations (\u00a76.1) is that \"it would be\r\npreferable to apply additional safety checks in this case\" (the case of\r\nallowing verification of ownership for domains which are public suffixes in\r\nthe \"PRIVATE\" division).  Is there any additional direction on what form such\r\nadditional safety checks might take or what goals they would need to serve?  I\r\ndo not think we need to have detailed directions in this document, but a sense\r\nfor what risks should get protected against would be useful.\r\n\r\n### Reference classification\r\n\r\nI think that [RFC1464] and [RFC3339] should move to the normative references\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n## Nits\r\n\r\n### temporary\r\n\r\nIn \u00a71 we talk about only one \"temporary DNS record\" being sufficient to prove\r\ncontrol, but that's the only instance of \"temporary\" in the document (we do\r\nsay \"time-bound\", but only after this instance of \"temporary\")... it's\r\nunclear if we want to have some other mention of it being temporary, or remove\r\nthat mention, or something else.\r\n\r\n### DNS Administrator\r\n\r\nWe use the term \"DNS Administrator\" a few times, but it's not in the\r\ndefinitions section.  Should it be (or those usages changed to \"User\")?\r\n\r\n### RR implementation list\r\n\r\nIn \u00a75 we list two things that the RR used to implement DCV includes.  In the\r\nHTML rendering, this is rendered as \"1) stuff 2) more stuff\" with no line\r\nbreak or conjunction.  Probably a line break would help, and I might also go\r\nwith \"with both:\" to clarify that it is an \"and\" statement rather than an \"or\"\r\none.\r\n\r\n### Github code\r\n\r\n\u00a7A.1.1.4 covers GitHub's _github-challenge-ORGANIZATION.DOMAIN, and says that\r\n\"[t]he code is a numeric code that expires in 7 days.\"  Is this \"code\" the\r\nrecord RDATA or something else?\r\n\r\n### Typical Let's Encrypt Usage\r\n\r\nIn \u00a7A.1.2.2.1 we say that \"[t]ypically, [DCV by Let's Encrypt or other CA] is\r\ndone via the [DNS-01] challenge.\"  I would probably weaken this to \"often\",\r\nrather than \"typically\", since I know of a number of sites that use the\r\nhttp-01 challenge via certbot or similar.",

Section 5.1.1 mixes up \"unique tokens\" and cryptographically secure random tokens, including having MUST-level requirements that are inappropriate.\n> \n> If an ASP wants to be sure that a particular user has control of a domain, it may be better for them to tell the user to put that user's ASP-associated name in the token because then the ASP doesn't have to store a long-term association between the user and the random value. Thus, the token is really not random, but is in fact unique for the site.\n> \n> Worse, Section 5.1.1 says that the random value must have 128 of entropy, even though the use case for DCV described in Section 3 has absolutely nothing to do with randomness. To be unique, the token can have a 32-bit number (assuming that the service doesn't have more than 4 billion users...).\n> \n> The implications of \"random\" will make the other good proposals in the document less likely to be implemented correctly. I propose that the document consistently use the term \"unique token\" throughout, that section 5.1.1 be rewritten to be about uniqueness, and the text in that section be amended to say \"if you want, a good way to generate unique tokens is to pick random values and then encode them this way\". This way, we will be describing a best practice (using a token) and telling the reader multiple ways to do so.\n> \n> I'm happy to propose specific text changes in the repo if the WG agrees.\n> ",

The target zone is only signed with an algorithm that validating resolvers are not expected to support, in which case the zone is inaccessible by normal validating resolvers and all lookups should be expected to ServFail. There is nothing special about the lookups the ASP does. The zone is just, for all intents and purposes, broken and non-resolving, and until this is fixed, it can't be validated. OR,\n2. The ASP is not following current standards for what signing algorithms they should support. In this case, they can either rectify that deficiency, or accept that they might not be able to validate some domains. This is not license for them to fail-open. Otherwise a bad actor could just claim they can't support anything beyond deprecated DSA/SHA1 and bypass the DNSSEC validation requirement entirely.\n\nIf you really think an action is needed to deal with these situations, at most it should be some added SHOULD text: The ASP SHOULD support for validation all signature algorithms currently (citing appropriate authority) required or recommended to be supported for validation, and the target zone SHOULD be signing with at least one of those algorithms.\n\n",

IN   TXT  \"3419...3d206c4\"\n>     IN TXT \"rbviluteebttjhihtvfbtrbjcdiihibu\"\n> \n> Maybe I'm not remembering correctly, but could these not be returned in arbitrary order, making the result non-deterministic?\n> \n> If you actually mean multiple \"character-string\"s are to be concatenated, isn't that what RFC 1035 says anyway?\n> \n> (2) The ABNF in Section 5.1.2 needs to be broken apart (i.e., it's formatted funny in this version, or at least it renders funny in HTML).\n> \n> (3) The SHOULD in Section 5.2 is curiously constructed.  I would suggest something like \"names SHOULD be registered\".\n> \n> Also, I wonder if some sort of hierarchical naming might be helpful here.  It might be tedious for IANA (or whoever) to register everything one might want to verify, versus registering provider names only and letting them use any sub-name they choose without registration.\n> \n> (4) In Section 5.1.2, the ABNF for \"value-char\" lists \"+\" twice.  Also I suggest considering importing a key-value ABNF pair that's already used someplace else that's more general, maybe DKIM or MIME.  If you decide you want to include a comma someday, for instance, this will all have to be revised, but why not anticipate it and make this more general?\n> \n> (5) Nearly all of the SHOULDs in here had me asking \"Why isn't this a MUST?\"  For instance, why would you not do the base32 encoding thing that's currently a SHOULD?  Or what's the impact if you don't?\n> \n> (6) For Section 5.1.2, is there any benefit to registering known metadata keys to avoid collisions in meaning?\n\n\nDavid Lawrence followed up on the first with:\n> > (1) Section 5.1 says multiple RDATAs are to be treated as concatenated.\n> \n> I'm a little confused by this wording too.

I would expect the 'key=' to have a value, but when there is no value, it would be defined as 'key' (without the '=').\n> Is it intended to allow 'key=' in the RDATA?\n> \n> #  6. Delegated Domain Control Validation\n> \n> In the second paragraph of section 6, the sentence 'The Intermediary gives the User a CNAME record to add for the domain and Application Service Provider being validated that points to the Intermediary's domain' is not specific enough, but then again the examples earlier in the draft show what should be used.\n> Sorry that I don't have a suggestion how it could be better worded.\n> \n> #  7.2. Service Confusion\n> \n> The word 'in' can be removed from 'While it would also have been possible to\n> include the scope in as an attribute in the TXT record'.\n> \n> #  8. Privacy Considerations\n> \n> I think the 'Domain Operators' can be replaced with 'DNS Administrator' since\n> the first is only used in this section and not defined in section 2.\n> ",

Erik Nygren has also made a comment that we should exclude validation of public suffixes, which seems reasonable to me.\r\n\r\nPaul - if aivencloud.com is in the PSL, then I think we can argue that its a public suffix, even if it's just for your own customers. \r\n\r\nSince your customers can register names under aivencloud.com, I think what we want to ensure is that: one of your (potential) customers cannot deploy a domain validation record for aivencloud.com itself, e.g. by registering <challenge_record>.aivencloud.com/TXT, or aivencloud.com/TXT. That seems like a reasonable precaution we should take.\r\n",

I'll propose some alternative text later this week.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the re are two divisions of the PSL, the ICANN section and the PRIVATE section:\r\nhttps://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki/Format#divisions\r\n\r\nA provider SHOULD take the PSL into account, but how may vary based on application.  (The PSL itself uses DCV TXT records to validate additions.)\r\nI'm thinking this boils down to:\r\n\r\n* Providers SHOULD NOT validate DCV entries for domains at or above \"ICANN\" public suffix entries, both for the name itself as well as for wildcards.  For example, \"com\" and \"*.com\" should not be allowed to be validated \r\n* Providers (MAY? SHOULD?) validate and allow DCV entries for domains at or above \"PRIVATE\" public suffix entries.  For example, if \"cdn.example\" is on the PSL as PRIVATE then _foo-challenge.cdn.example (SHOULD?) be allowed.  (aivencloud.com is in this PRIVATE division.)\r\n\r\nWe might want to encourage additional checks on PSL entries, but I'm not sure how we might do this.  At a minimum, we should have a security consideration that there's a risk exposure if you have a domain on the PSL and allow customers to provision arbitrary names under that domain (eg, as a CDN or Dynamic DNS provider) but also allow those customers to provision names starting with \"_\".\r\n\r\nNote that this also overlaps with DBOUND (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-tjw-dbound2-problem-statement-01) but we don't have anything to point to today.  I'm not sure if we should make a forward reference to any future DBOUND specification, or at least leave a hook for DBOUND to plug into later.",

In fact, we see that fairly routinely with TXT record based validation records (e.g. for <something.salesforce.com is being validated but it already had a CNAME pointing somewhere).\r\n\r\nI added a general paragraph about this in pitfalls, and adjusted the text in the 'CNAME based methods' section.\r\n\r\nI also added some harsher words regarding broken implementations that allow CNAME and other data, in clear violation of the DNS protocol.\r\n\r\nPlease review.\r\n",

There are other valid reasons to avoid that practice and networks with broken DNS-over-TCP shouldn\u2019t be coddled.\r\n\r\nI didn't address this since this section in the document just describes Common Pitfalls related to domain validation and doesn't (and shouldn't need to) comment on whether the pitfalls should exist in the first place.\r\n\r\n> > The presence of a Validation Record with a predictable domain name\r\n> > (either as a TXT record for the exact domain name where control is\r\n> > being validated or with a well-known label) can allow attackers to\r\n> > enumerate utilized set of Application Service Providers.\r\n> \r\n> Not sure I buy this argument.  Doesn\u2019t the draft recommend using predictable names anyway, just one per provider?\r\n\r\nIt does, but we discuss in section 5.2 (last para) how this pitfall can be addressed i.e. by \"prepending a random token to the owner name of a validation record\".\r\n \r\n> > APIs SHOULD be used to relay instructions.\r\n> \r\n> Not sure I follow this.

This is consistent with the approach used by most ordinary DNS records, including AAAA, MX, CNAME, and NS.

Some reasons:\r\n\r\n* It avoids errors of reasoning where someone checks the validity of the record and concludes that it demonstrates control, when that is no longer true.\r\n* It encourages use of meaningful zone content for authorization, instead of opaque identifiers.  This aids debugging and removes the need for a database to track the meaning of various high-entropy blobs.\r\n* It avoids accidental outages when DCV records are removed after the challenge is completed (because they _look_ just like the ephemeral challenge records that are usually safe to remove).",

As an example, with ACME a common use-case is for the _acme-challenge.www.example.com to be a CNAME to an intermediate (eg, on a CDN) that the intermediate uses on a recurring basis to re-validate new certificates.  The ongoing presence of the _acme-challenge.www.example.com is not time-bounded and has meaning that the intermediate can continue to revalidate new certificates.  There are likely similar use-cases for this.  The whole DV cert ecosystem relies heavily on this.\r\n\r\nI also see CAA as being orthogonal to DCV.  We'd talked about this some but decided to leave it out other than a brief mention.  DCV provides explicit proof of control (whether ephemeral or persistent) while CAA is constraining the allowed set of control. What is allowed is the intersection between these two.  This pattern may be useful elsewhere (eg, we may want a separate draft similar to this one that generalizes the DNS-based constraints that CAA does (but which fixes some of the CAA issues), but this is separate than CAA providing a persistent authorization.  Including \"LetsEncrypt,Digicert\" in a CAA record doesn't authorize to LetsEncrypt or Digicert but rather says that anything outside of those two is prohibited.\r\n\r\n(Separately there are some highly problematic protocol design issues with CAA from a DNS perspective, but that is not relavant here.)",

              "body": "This thread is getting a bit long to usefully reply to, but I will try to make a few points that seem to tie to unresolved topics:\r\n- the high-entropy token serves to bind the validation to the account at the provider (the provider only issues the token to the specific account) but it is a single-use token for that purpose (once it is published in the DNS everybody knows it and it is no longer useful for binding the domain validation to the account on an ongoing basis).\r\n- I agree that CAA and the CNAME to an intermediate are conveying ongoing authorization information rather than domain validation information directly.  We still want to use a random value for the CNAME target to get account binding for the initial iteration (see previous bullet point), and that points to a scenario where there are some intrinsically non-separable behaviors that combine the one-time/ephemeral and ongoing properties of a single DNS record.\r\n- I think the (proposed) text as-is is confusing/unhelpful, since it is essentially an appeal to authority (\"ACME does it this way, so that must be good\").  It would be better to have more discussion of how these are related but distinct topics and why we might choose to handle them distinctly.\r\n\r\nReading the above, I'm coming around to a stance that there is both a time-bounded and a potentially longer-lived aspect to DCV -- the time-bounded part is the binding of (account at provider) to (domain validation instance), but that a given validation record can remain in place to indicate an ongoing desire (or authorization if you want) to continue doing the operation that was initiated with the initial validation.  I would be ok recommending a different record for ongoing authorization that is entirely separate from any domain validation (which CAA is), but I don't think that a blanket statement forbidding combining domain validation and ongoing authorization is workable.",

The removal proposal is separate in PR 170.\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\nAfter domain control validation is completed, there is no need for the TXT or CNAME record to continue to exist because the presence of the domain validation DNS record for a service only implies that a User with access to the service also has DNS control of the domain at the time the code was generated. It should be safe to remove the validation DNS record once the validation is done and the Application Service Provider doing the validation should specify how long the validation will take (i.e., after how much time can the validation DNS record be deleted).\r\n\r\nSome Application Service Providers currently require the Validation Record to remain in the zone indefinitely for periodic revalidation purposes. This practice should be discouraged. Subsequent validation actions using an already disclosed token are no guarantee that the original owner is still in control of the domain, and a new challenge needs to be issued.\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

Most other threat models appear to be stand-alone RFCs.  I drew from STAMP terminology here, but rather than incorporating this as an analysis I list the Unacceptable Losses and Hazards up-front and then reference them throughout from the sections intended to mitigate them.\r\n\r\nPlacement and length of the threat model is also a trade-off here, but given that this draft's purpose is to mitigate the threats it seemed worth including it early on (but not so early as to lack context for the reader).\r\n",
